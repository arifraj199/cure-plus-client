            The career that I want to pursue is to be a cardiologist. A
            cardiologist is a doctor that specializes in all things heart
            including the blood vessels. This means that if a patient went to
            visit their primary physician and the physician detected a problem
            with the patientâ€™s heart. The physician will then give a referral to
            the patient so that the patient can go to a cardiologist. The
            cardiologist will then will review the patient history and perform
            many tests such as a physical exam, ECG (electro cardiogram), blood
            test and an X-ray.
